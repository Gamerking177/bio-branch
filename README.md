      - <i>Dropdown menu --> "+ Create a new Fork" </i>
      
      ![step1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9e82970-f403-41bf-b4b6-cc3052616b3e)
     
      - <i>Dont change the suggested repo name and just click on "Create Fork" button.</i>

    ![bb2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48069088-1373-4ff8-9c25-00fa4cfcf0ff)

   
4. **Add a Remote upstream to original repo for reference**:
   
- In this way, you can feasibly update your forked repo with the original repo changes. Ensure you execute this cmd in the "bio-branch" directory
  
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/subhadipbhowmik/bio-branch.git
   

5. **Verify remote origin and upstream**:
   
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   
  -  the following response appear:
  ```bash
   origin  https://github.com/<your username>/bio-branch.git (fetch)
   origin  https://github.com/<your username>/bio-branch.git (push)
  upstream https://github.com/subhadipbhowmik/bio-branch.git (fetch)
  upstream https://github.com/subhadipbhowmik/bio-branch.git (push) 
```

6. **Always make a pull from the upstream repository to your main branch to keep it updated with the original repository.**
   -  Ensure you are in the main bio-branch directory
   ```bash
   git pull upstream main
   
7. **Install the dependencies**:
   

- Backend changes:
  ```bash
   cd server
   npm install / yarn start
   npm start
  
- Now-
  
   <code>Server is running at http://localhost:4000</code>

- Frontend changes:
  ```bash
  cd site
  npm install
  npm run dev
  # or
  yarn dev
  # or
  pnpm dev
  
- Now, the frontend is running locally-
  
  <code>ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000</code>
  You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.js. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
   
8. **Create a new branch**:
   
   ```bash
   git checkout -b <feature-branch>

9. **Work on the issue**:
- Perform the proposed changes in your new branch and ensure everything works.

10. **Track your changes**:
    
    ```bash
    git status
    git diff

11. **Stage and Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: <description>"
```

12. **Ensure you push the committed changes in your feature branch to your own remote repository**
    ```bash
    git push -u origin <feature-branch>

13. **Next, create a Pull Request**
    - Go to your forked repository on GitHub, click "Compare & pull request."
